# World Layoffs Analysis
## Background
This is the first project I took on in SQL. It involves me following allowing with [Alex the Analys](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst) and writing out code and checking with his solution compared to mine

This was the first real practice I gained with CTEs and Window Functions as well as working with a much larger dataset. 
## Task
Finding out relevant data about layoffs from different companies around the world.

## Questions
- Which companies had the most layoffs during this time period
- Which industries had the most layoffs 
- Which countries had the most layoffs 
- Which yearss had the most layoffs
- create a rolling total from each month starting in 2020 all the way to 2023
- grab the top 5 companies each year by how many layoffs
